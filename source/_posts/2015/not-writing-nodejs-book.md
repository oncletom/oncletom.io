If you have started writing a book 2 years ago and have not committed any single line since a few months, chances are there is certainly a problem out there.

It happened to me: **I stopped writing** my *Node.js* book but **I will not necessarily *end* the project** itself. Here is *why*.

# tl;dr

Writing a book is indeed excellent to learn new traits of knowledge. Although one has to acknowledge it is an extremely hard *commitment*, almost *sacrificial*.

Ultimately, we now have the tools to write books in a different way, more distributed and less focused on the word of the expert.

# Writing is a sacrifice

> Wow you write a book, that's awesome! You are such an expert ðŸ˜»

The truth is **writing 300 pages of non-fictional content is a damn painful sacrifice**. Not to mention it takes an awful lot of time. A time you will never be able to spend on anything else. Physical and mental energy drained by making your brain working full speed. Regularly. Every day. For loads and loads of mornings, evenings and week-ends. For months.

This sets pretty good conditions to enable burnouts.

I still have [Swizec Teller](http://swizec.com/)'s talk in mind. He presented [What I learned writing a lousy tech book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1L2SgQuv6Q) at [Write the Docs 2014](http://docs.writethedocs.org/2014/eu/).

So despite public recognition and learning, the *commitment* itself costs a lot. Is it worth it? Is it financially worth it? I would tend to say that **writing a technical book in French on your own is not worth it, life-wise speaking**.

It is a one man effort for very little gain. Of course if your life is dedicated to become and/or to remain a top-notch technical expert it is *"fine"* (de-*fine* â€” recursive acronym).

I am at a stage in my life where I prefer to spend quality time â€” with people I love or on my own â€” than by nailing myself to my desk and a keyboard. Simply because **I will never get this time back**.

# Publishers are essentials

> What about writing and publishing your chapters gradually on services such as [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/)?

I think publishers are still essential and important actors. But their working model is outdated. They endanger themselves by not transitioning to less monolithic work process.

Roles of a publisher:

- pushing book on the bookstore shelves
- ensuring its promotion (fares, events, catalogues and various displays)
- entry point for {rental, legitimacy}
- role of curator (their name means something if the author is not well known â€” we don't all live in the Valley nor are WASP)
- support (content structure, typos, grammarâ€¦)
- broaden your impact (your role is to create the content, they broadcast it to {an, your} audience)
- deal with rights and legal issues

Hard to say in this case they are useless, or self-publishing will traditional book publishing.

In a world of noise, abundance and profusion, [curation is crucial](https://medium.com/cuepoint/consider-the-mix-tape-9f37839c1246).

# Towards transmissive and collaborative writing

> So if writing is such a pain, what are you going to do?

From solo writing to workshops. Moving from an top-down expert to community facilitator. Writing by asking. From questions, by adding an example, rephrasing, to specialists writing a single page on a topic they are likely to share their knowledge about, from people writing about a part they would like to learn about and benefiting to a gentle community feedback.

{% pullquote emphasis %}
You can be an author simply by asking a question.
{% endpullquote %}

I would like to use this mechanism to finish at least two more chapters:

- *frontend development* with Node and npm
- *production ready*, from deployment to hosting

# Workshops schedule

Move part time in September, **every Friday**. You are welcome to do WFH from my home (a cool and spacious warehouse in Tottenham Hale) and to combine your work and contributions.

- [BordeauxJS](http://www.meetup.com/bordeauxjs/) (Bordeaux, France) 14th October 2015
- [bdx.io](http://www.bdx.io) (Bordeaux, France) 16th October 2015
- [Blend WebMix](http://www.blendwebmix.com) (Lyon, France) 28/29th October 2015
- [MozFest](https://2015.mozillafestival.org) (London, UK) 6/7th November 2015
- [Codeurs en Seine](http://www.codeursenseine.com) (Nantes, France) 26th November 2015
- [DotJS](http://www.dotjs.io/) (Paris, France) 7th December 2015

> But, your book is written in French right?

Yes. Although the content is quite universal and code snippets speak for themselves. Workshops are going to be topic-based, explanatory and practical at the same time.

I â€” and other French speaking contributors if they want â€” will take care of the translation.



# Towards a new publishing model

I would still like to push the book onto the shelves. The idea is to get back to my French publisher ([Eyrolles](http://eyrolles.fr)) and to propose them the following plan:

- the author's name on the cover would be *Thomas Parisot â€” and contributors*;
- the publishing contract is kept as is for the sake of simplicity (and because I am not sure the legal model enables shared rights with a dozen of people or more â€” could be looked after though);
- royalties are still sent to my bank account.

**But** I would also like to revise how the money will be used:

- I agree to throw all the book royalties into a shared *money pot*;
- contributors get granted an equal percentage of shares (which should include GH issues authors and participants);
- we collectively design who we would like to redirect our shares to â€” assuming they have contributed to the Node.js ecosystem in some sort (npm modules authors, OSS project, education charity, open knowledge foundation);
- remaining/unallocated money will go to a designated charity â€” and not in my pocket nor a contributor.

Hopefully Eyrolles and other publisher could benefit from this experience. It does not mean we need to get rid of experts books. It just means there are other ways to write a book than by burning its author(s). A model of *technical facilitators* in addition to *solo experts*.

# Conclusion


I am probably even more reluctant to write that I favour more and more a distributed approach. Distributed responsibilities, distributed design, distributed architectures. [The bazaar over the cathedral](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/).

I am looking for this non-vertical approach of knowledge and to step aside of a very hierarchical organisation or a celebrity-orientated industry. Empowering vs. reigning.

And because of course, *readers* have a lot to teach to *writers*.

I think **we can transmit *more* than written knowledge**. We can share the *writing* experience as well as a *laughter* with contributors. *Any kind* of contributors. And to grow our network of knowledge and our (offline) social network.

We can gradually learn how to move from a socially passive to an active form of hacktivism. And to cross-pollinate such a process  and experience in our respective disciplines and jobs.

I don't know what you think about it, but I find this approach way more exciting than spending my nights writing, alone, wrapped in my bedsheets.
