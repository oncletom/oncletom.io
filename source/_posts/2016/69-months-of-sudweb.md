What is better than *50 shades of Grey*? 69 months of conference organisation. Almost **6 years**!

**Why leaving** while being one of the founder members? And **what did I learn** throughout our yearly iterations? This is what we will focus on.

# tl;dr

Working on a non-profit event project for years was both an experimental lab and a source of self-awareness.

# What is Sud Web?

Sud Web was born in October 2010 in the midst of a [French web conference which taught me so much](http://www.paris-web.fr/). A few folks stood up and asked for help to organise a conference in the South of France. With all to do in less than 6 months. Challenge accepted!
  
At the time, there was not so many web related events happening outside of Paris and we shared that vision of creating something slightly different, less focused on the latest tech nor the latest spec.

Sud Web was born like this, as a **yearly conference about web development and web design**, moving from town to town, bathing in the **good spirit of the South of France**.

# Our choices

- XP + testimony
- petite taille
- être et faire ensemble
- editorialisation de la journée
- valeurs solides
- créer la conf où on a envie d'aller
- prendre soin

# From infancy to maturity

- technique -> humain
- cfp -> curation + cfp
- 100% organisé -> cadre + auto-organisation
- XP -> XP + inspiration
- web -> around the web / interdisciplinarité (prolongement et contenu dans la réalité)
- être bon au boulot -> être bien dans sa peau (et dans son cerveau)

# What I am proud of

## Speaker curation


## Tooling

# Lessons learnt

- simplifier
- créer une culture
- être résilient aux problèmes
- vie/modèle associatif décentralisé
- écriture des contenus : à la fois les orateurs (contenu) et vers les orateurs
- curation : choix et prise de responsabilité plutôt que renouvellement en cercle de gens connaissant déjà la conf
- organiser à 4 c'est faisable

# Why now?

- at its best
- sold out in 2 weeks, great reviews and great feedbacks of genuinely happy people
- envie de faire autre chose (ou rien du tout)

- good time for the conference to iterate and reflect on itself and get a different vision from mine in order to perpetuate itself and include its own evolution in its core values
- it is a good time to eventually fail once and to improve upon the experience of failure without much harm

# Conclusion

Six years ago, I thought I were a web developer.

Now, I can say with confidence I am good at designing software, innovation and photography. I also enjoy my apprenticeship in bread making, volunteering and permaculture.

I embraced **shifting from a job title to many skills-related activities** — some of them are paid, some of them are unpaid.
