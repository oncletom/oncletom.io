What is better than *50 shades of Grey*? 69 months of conference organisation. Almost **6 years**!

**Why leaving** while being one of the founder members? And **what did I learn** throughout our yearly iterations? This is what we will focus on.

# tl;dr

Working on a non-profit event project for years was both an experimental lab and a source of self-awareness.

# What is Sud Web?

Sud Web was born in October 2010 in the midst of a [French web conference which taught me so much](http://www.paris-web.fr/). A few folks stood up and asked for help to organise a conference in the South of France. Everything had to be done in less than 6 months. *Challenge* accepted!
  
At the time, there were not so many web related events happening outside of Paris. Part of us shared a common vision of creating something slightly different, less focused on the latest tech nor the latest spec.

Sud Web was born like this, as a **yearly conference about web development and web design**, moving from town to town, bathing in the **good spirit of the South of France**.

# Our choices

We started with implicit choices but strong ones: **favouring feedbacks and experience sharing** rather than listicles (e.g.: *10 ways to be an awesome {developer, designer, etc.}*) and name dropping talks (e.g.: *{React, HTML5, etc.} for the win*) within a **voluntarily small audience** (120 tickets, including discounted fares for students and job seekers).

We wanted to reflect our intuition through the baseline of Sud Web: *savoir-faire et faire savoir* (a pun around *know-how and how to make it known*). We identified our former intuition and transformed them in **explicit values** after two or three editions.

We also wanted to design the conference over two days: one day of talks and one day of workshops based on the [OpenSpace principles](http://www.mindviewinc.com/Conferences/OpenSpaces.html). There is nothing better than enabling and **empowering people to organise hands-on sessions** based on an inspiring first one. - editorialisation de la journée

In the end, **we created and learned to shape the conference we wanted to attend every year**, content and format included.

# From infancy to maturity

- technique -> humain
- cfp -> curation + cfp
- 100% organisé -> cadre + auto-organisation
- XP -> XP + inspiration
- web -> around the web / interdisciplinarité (prolongement et contenu dans la réalité)
- être bon au boulot -> être bien dans sa peau (et dans son cerveau)

# What I am proud of

## Speaker curation


## Tooling

# Lessons learnt

- simplifier
- créer une culture
- être résilient aux problèmes
- vie/modèle associatif décentralisé
- écriture des contenus : à la fois les orateurs (contenu) et vers les orateurs
- curation : choix et prise de responsabilité plutôt que renouvellement en cercle de gens connaissant déjà la conf
- organiser à 4 c'est faisable

# Why now?

- at its best
- sold out in 2 weeks, great reviews and great feedbacks of genuinely happy people
- envie de faire autre chose (ou rien du tout)

- good time for the conference to iterate and reflect on itself and get a different vision from mine in order to perpetuate itself and include its own evolution in its core values
- it is a good time to eventually fail once and to improve upon the experience of failure without much harm

# Conclusion

Six years ago, I thought I were a web developer.

Now, I can say with confidence I am good at designing software, innovation and photography. I also enjoy my apprenticeship in bread making, volunteering and permaculture.

I embraced **shifting from a job title to many skills-related activities** — some of them are paid, some of them are unpaid.
