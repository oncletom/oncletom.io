Applying for a new job usually requires to write a cover letter. I frequently felt it was a boring administrative task rather than a useful one. It **took me 10 years to figure out how useful it can be** — when properly executed.

Here are some handful elements to **understand how to write a cover letter** and **how it is going to be read** by the recruiters… and maybe your future colleagues.

# tl;dr

Writing a good cover letter is a matter of mapping your skills and experience with the organisation and work needs. It is a unique opportunity to connect the dots and state your understanding of the role you want to dive into.

# A bit of background

I have had the chance to be involved in the hiring process a year after I started my first job. Which throws us back to 2004. The experience has been renewed a couple of times and despite some mistakes and lack of seniority.

I had to hire 4 engineers when we built a startup from scratch (and eventually [failed a few months later](/2014/why-our-startup-failed/)). This has been the first time I thought of having been able to work in a *perfect team*. So smoothly. So intelligently.

Applying for a job and hiring people at the BBC taught me some knowledge to an entire new level. This is because the [BBC follows a *fair recruitment policy*](http://www.bbc.co.uk/careers/help/recruitment-process). People have to be judged against comparable criteria. To some extent, **each application has to be a reproducible trace of data points**.

1. State the obvious

3. Illustrate the desired skills with your own experience
TBD;
4. Get to know the structure organisational chart
TBD/who you would be likely to report to;
5. Recruiters have expectations and are likely to tick boxes to filter the applicants
TBD;
6. Bullshitting is dead obvious — so don't bullshit
It is harder to fake facts and experience;

# Hands on with a real example

The rest of this blog post will focus on a job advert for a [Technical Lead, Center for Civic Media](http://www.media.mit.edu/about/opportunities/technical-lead-center-civic-media) at the MIT Media Lab.

This job advert is very relevant to me and my work at [BBC R&D](http://bbc.co.uk/rd). As the MIT Media Lab does not sponsor working visa, I literally have no chance to get it so I do not consider this exercise as a conflictual matter of fact.

The idea is to walk you through the application as I would apply to it in the real world.

## Description

> The Media Cloud project (http://mediacloud.org) is seeking a technical lead to help us build tools that facilitate research about the role of digital media in civic discourse. Media Cloud is an open source and open data project that produces its own research about the networked public sphere and also facilitates others' research about online media by making available to the public its existing archive of more than 365 million stories and by collecting more than 300,000 new stories daily. The technical lead will drive all technical aspects of the project, working with the principal research scientist that leads the research team to plan, design, build, and run all levels of the project's platform -- back end tools that collect and archive the platform's data, researcher tools that enable analysis of that data, and front end tools that expose the data and analysis to the public. This is a unique opportunity to both shape the concept and contribute to the hands-on development of tools.
>
> Media Cloud is a joint project between the Center for Civic Media at MIT and the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University. The position will be based at the Center for Civic Media, but the technical lead will work closely with members of the team from both centers. The project is funded by human rights foundations, for whom we produce both the open platform and research that helps them making decisions about how best to influence online civic conversations about democracy, activism, and health.
>
> We are a diverse team of researchers and technologists who love to wrestle with hard questions about online media by using a combination of social, computer, and data sciences. The ideal candidate will work well with all members of the team, from the principal research scientist to junior developers, and will thrive in an academic atmosphere that encourages constant questioning and validation at all levels of the platform and of our research products.
>
> Much of our substantive work focuses on issues of gender, race, and globalization. We strongly encourage women, people of color, and people of any sexual identity to apply.
>
> The job is based in Cambridge, MA, but much of our team is distributed around the world. We are open to flexible onsite working arrangements.
>
> This is a one-year appointment with the possibility of extension.
