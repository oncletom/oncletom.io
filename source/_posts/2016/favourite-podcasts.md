I have been late in the game: I started to listen to podcasts only since summer 2014.

Since then, I (re)discovered and reinvented my relationship with the radiophonic medium and found a _new_ **way to learn and wander** at the same time.

<!--more-->

# tl;dr

I think podcasts and radio programmes can be an **additional source of enlightenment** to books. They are *easy to fit* in our every day life. Hopefully this selection of my favourite podcasts will nudge your curiosity.

# podcast = audio + delivery

First of all, the very base definition of a podcast could be the following: **an audio content downloadable from the web and you can subscribe to**; to get notified of new episodes.

Think of an *audio article*, as if your favourite [New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/podcast) or [the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/audio) long reads could be transposed to an audio format programme.

# Publishers

Podcasts can be edited by **web based publishers** (e.g.: *On Being* or *JavaScript Jabber*), **brick and mortar organisations** (e.g.: *the London School of Economics*, *the Guardian* or *Harvard University*) and eventually by **radio broadcasters** (e.g.: the *BBC*, *npr* or *France Inter*).

A radio receiver requires to scrub frequencies to listen to broadcasted programmes with no intrinsic way to catch up, unless a programme is aired again.

Podcasts enable you **to listen to on demand content** and eventually you end up **subscribing to your favourite programmes updates** with an ability to listen *online* or *offline*.

Luckily for us, **most of the radio programmes are also edited as podcasts** so we  can listen to them months or years later.

# Why, when and how to listen to podcasts?

I used to rely on books and essays **to expand my views of the world**. I really got onto podcasts when I found the ones which taught me things. I mostly listen to them **while walking** and **commuting**. Sometimes when I **lie on my bed**, speakers out.

I mainly use mobile applications:

- [Player.fm](https://player.fm/) on Android;
- [Overcast](http://overcast.fm/) on iOS.

I heard good things about:

- [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/podcasts/) on macOS;
- [gPodder](http://gpodder.org/) on Windows, Linux and macOS.

Then I found out it is mostly about a **balance of time**: how many subscriptions, how frequent, how long — it is a very personal matter. I started removing the subscriptions I listened the less to clear the queue and prevent any podcast obesity. I tried some (like [99% invisible](http://99percentinvisible.org/), [this American Life](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/) and [Serial](https://serialpodcast.org/)) but unsubscribed because I did not get into them or found them too verbose/lengthy.

# My selection of english programmes

I had to start working at the BBC to force myself to turn on the radio to understand its landscape. I browsed _BBC radio_ programmes, then _npr_ to get an american counterpart. And finally got on original web programmes.

## On Being

A regular dose of great **guests speaking about the inner mind**, how we deal with our emotions and our weaknesses as well as our strengths. I discovered _danah boyd_'s research thanks to it.

## Invisiblia

An **editorialised approach of the invisible forces which drive us**. I learned quite a lot around areas I was interested in: emotions, creativity, fulfilment, finding a balance etc.

- duration: 30 minutes
- [programme page](http://www.npr.org/programs/invisibilia/)

- when: every *day*
- duration: ~2 minutes
- [programme page](https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcast/60-second-science/)

## Hidden Brain

I discovered it in September 2016. I loved their **exploration of how the brain can be at work** where I did not expect it to do so.

- who: [npr](http://www.npr.org/)
- when: every *week* (series)
- duration: 5 minutes to 30 minutes

## The why factor

**Similar topics as _Hidden Brain_** but with a British accent on top of it, and a bit punchier. I like the pace of the programme, with interleaved interviews, scientific facts and some twists of humour.

- who: [BBC World Service](http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldserviceradio)
- when: every *week*
- duration: ~20 minutes
- [programme page](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00xtky9)

  - [Sad music](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02hl73g)

Still _scientific_ but less _brain_ orientated: I like learning about **everyday life scientific situations** in a clear and straight-to-the-point way.

- who: [BBC Radio 4](http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4)
- when: every *week*
- duration: ~30 minutes

**I never know what I will get** out of these episodes… and that's why I like this programme.

- when: every *week* (seasonal)
- duration: 30 minutes
- [programme page](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01mk3f8)

## Fresh Air

A very good show which **showcases work** from authors, philosophers and scientists. I discovered _Oliver Sacks_ thanks to it – sadly not too long before his death.

I also do not hesitate to _skip episodes_ due to their length and frequency.

- who: [npr](http://www.npr.org/)
- when: every *day*
- duration: 50 minutes
- [programme page](http://www.npr.org/programs/fresh-air/)
- favourite episodes:
  - [Oliver Sacks: A Neurologist At The 'Intersection Of Fact And Fable'](http://www.npr.org/programs/fresh-air/2015/08/31/436291296/fresh-air-for-august-31-2015)

## Data Stories

A **broad exploration of the world of data** with guests ranging from scientists and programmers to conference reports and artists. I like the mix of shared experience and scientific theories. The duo of presenters makes it easy to digest and the **episodes pages contain additional visual graphics** and information.

- who: Enrico Bertini and Moritz Stefaner
- when: every *week*
- duration: ~60 minutes
- [programme page](http://datastori.es/)
- favourite episodes:

  - [Data Installations w/ Domestic Data Streamers](http://datastori.es/data-stories-58-domestic-data-streamers/)

## Benjamen Walker's Theory of Everything

This one is a bit crazier, very chatty and I like how Benjamen deep dives into **society frictions, fears and problems**. Plus he knows how to phrase issues and to mock them gently.

- who: _Benjamen Walker_
- when: every *other week*
- duration: it depends
- [programme page](https://toe.prx.org/)
- favourite episodes:
  - Instaserfs: [part 1](https://toe.prx.org/2015/06/instaserfs-i-of-iii/), [part 2](https://toe.prx.org/2015/06/instaserfs-ii-of-iii/) and [part 3](https://toe.prx.org/2015/07/instaserfs-iii-of-iii/)

# My selection of french programmes

Interestingly enough, I (re)discovered French radio programmes after discovering the british and north american landscapes. It is only in 2015, at 32 years old, I realised how rich, solid and insightful the French radio offer was.

## Club Jazzafip

**I built all my _jazz knowledge_** and _discovered great artists_ — classic and contemporary ones — with this radio programme before moving to the UK. You don't have to understand french to appreciate the music and the soothing voice of the presenters.

# Conclusion

I like podcasts for the **continuity** they offer in term of topic exploration. Their content would scratch the surface, expose me to knowledge I was not aware of or deep dive in a very specific fragment of a discipline – you might have guessed my favourites: psychology, history and sciences. It became my **main tool of knowledge discovery**.

I **switch back to book essays** when I want to deep dive in a topic or to go beyond what I discovered in a podcast.

Listening to podcasts is format which **fits very well with commute**, transportations and situations where I want to relax my eyes and keep my hands free. I dedicate a tiny iPod touch to fit my **offline content on the go**.

Feel free to share your favourite podcasts and why you loved them in the comments below 😊.
