I have taken the habit to use a **single domain** as an umbrella for **multiple websites**. Which in short means we can benefit from different software stacks being hosted on different platforms.

As a bonus, we can use a [custom domain on GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/) with our own SSL certificate.

# tl;dr

Apache `ProxyPass` and `ProxyPassReverse` are our best friend to mount an external URL (and its descendants) onto a folder of our very own domain.

# Why using a reverse proxy?

We are in 2016 and mentioning [reverse proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy) in a conversation sounds odd and pretty much dated from a different century. But hey, who cares?

I use reverse proxies for various reasons:

1. **to isolate components**
  So instead of putting everything in a larger and larger monolithic website, we can manage them as **different git repositories** and have a **different build process** as well (like `/photography` and `/talks` on this website)
1. **to manage different stacks**
  In the case of a conference with a yearly edition or so, we can iterate over the software stack and change accordingly to our needs **without having to upgrade legacy editions** nor to keep continuing them because you feel obliged to.
1. **to provide a transparent experience to our users**
  We can host content in different places and still provide a coherent experience to a user without having them to feel the spread of our infrastructure.
1. **to upgrade individual components**
  One by one rather than the entire stacks. Which makes the life easier in term of Q&A scope. Obviously, we fall in the [microservices trap](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) so the more individual projects we have, the more scattered our attention and efforts can be.
1. **to run Docker containers or web applications**
  We can prevent to expose them directly on the port 80 or 443 â€“ although this is not the point of this article as we are rather focused on *proxying external content*.

It is a good way to hide complex and purposeful components under a same and apparently unique domain. This is for example how websites like the [BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/) **feel like one** website whereas they are in reality composed of dozens and **dozens of different websites** developed by *independent* teams.

# How does it work?

An HTTP request to your hosting provider will usually look like the following examples:

```
# Root
example.com â†’ VirtualHost â†’ /var/www/example.com

# Folder
example.com/cheese â†’ VirtualHost â†’ /var/www/example.com/cheese

# Specific file
example.com/doc/index.html â†’ VirtualHost â†’ /var/www/example.com/doc/index.html
```

By default we assume the folders `/cheese` and `/doc` are contained in the same directory as the root of the website.

Let's say we actually have decided to opt in for a whitelabeled content provider for a part of the website and moved another part of it to a static website hosted on GitHub. The above example would evolve into:

```
# Root
example.com â†’ VirtualHost â†’ /var/www/example.com

# Folder
example.com/cheese â†’ VirtualHost + ProxyPass â†’ http://cheese.com/whitelabel/example.com

# File
example.com/doc/index.html â†’ VirtualHost + ProxyPass â†’ http://example.github.io/site-doc/index.html
```

It should be clear enough so let's dive a bit more in how to achieve this.

# Configuring ProxyPass

The configuration of a reverse mainly relies on a declaration of `ProxyPass` for each path (and its descendants) you would like to host elsewhere:

```
<VirtualHost *>
  ServerName example.com
  DocumentRoot /var/www/example.com

  <IfModule mod_proxy.c>
    ProxyPreserveHost Off

    ProxyPass /cheese http://cheese.com/whitelabel/example.com
    ProxyPassReverse /cheese http://cheese.com/whitelabel/example.com

    ProxyPass /doc http://example.github.io/site-doc
    ProxyPassReverse /doc http://example.github.io/site-doc
  </IfModule>
</VirtualHost>
```

And that's pretty much it!

# Configuring Proxy directives

I found [Apache `ProxyPass`](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_proxy.html#proxypass) documentation to be quite clear actually (or maybe I spent too much time reading it). We can manage to exclude folders from the proxying or match only specific patterns with `ProxyPassMatch`. I guess all we need is a use case before starting to use them ðŸ˜Š.

## `ProxyPreserveHost`

This setting has an influence on how your VirtualHost proxy server will advertise the `Host` HTTP header to the client.

With `ProxyPreserveHost On`:

```bash
curl --head http://example.com/cheese
HTTP/1.1 200 Found
Host: cheese.com
```

With `ProxyPreserveHost Off`:

```bash
curl --head http://example.com/cheese
HTTP/1.1 200 Found
Host: example.com
```

So in general we will want to have it set to `Off`, especially in the case of web browsers and relative link computation.

## `ProxyPassReverse`

This *reverse* directive indicates Apache how to treat *location* headers emitted by the backend of the proxy.

In other words, if the backend emits some headers like `Location` and  `Content-Location`, your proxy will *rewrite* them to match your VirtualHost.

Without `ProxyPassReverse`:

```bash
curl --head http://example.com/cheese/old-uri
HTTP/1.1 301 Redirect
Location: http://cheese.com/whitelabel/example.com/new-uri
```

With `ProxyPassReverse`:

```bash
curl --head http://example.com/cheese
HTTP/1.1 301 Redirect
Location: http://example.com/cheese/new-uri
```

## `ProxyPassReverseCookieDomain`

This is exactly the same principle as `ProxyPassReverse` but for any `Cookie` header emitted by the backend.

## `SSLProxyEngine`

This one will enable the proxy module to deal with HTTPS requests. You could definitely have an HTTP to HTTPS or, better, HTTPS to HTTP â€“ to secure insecure parts of your website. Or to secure themâ€¦ with a different SSL certificate.

And that's precisely one advantage to use a reverse proxy in front of GitHub Pages to use your custom domain and your own certificate.

# Reverse Proxy over HTTPS

GitHub serves every [GitHub Page website over HTTPS](https://help.github.com/articles/securing-your-github-pages-site-with-https/) only if they have been created after *June 15<sup>th</sup> 2016*. So you will have to make sure both your server can talk over SSL with GitHub by enabling `mod_ssl`.

```
# âˆ¨âˆ¨âˆ¨âˆ¨âˆ¨âˆ¨ We add this line
LoadModule ssl_module /wherever/is/apache2/modules/mod_ssl.so
# âˆ§âˆ§âˆ§âˆ§âˆ§âˆ§

<VirtualHost *>
  ServerName example.com

  <IfModule mod_proxy.c>
    ProxyPreserveHost Off

    # âˆ¨âˆ¨âˆ¨âˆ¨âˆ¨âˆ¨ and this one too.
    SSLProxyEngine On
    # âˆ§âˆ§âˆ§âˆ§âˆ§âˆ§

    # âˆ¨âˆ¨âˆ¨âˆ¨âˆ¨âˆ¨ Look, the backend URL now is over the https scheme!
    ProxyPass /doc https://example.github.io/site-doc
    ProxyPassReverse /doc https://example.github.io/site-doc
  </IfModule>
</VirtualHost>
```

As an alternative, you can also run the following to globally enable `mod_ssl` :

```bash
$ a2enmod mod_ssl
```

By doing so, you do not need to write the `LoadModule` line.

If you cannot enable `mod_ssl`, well you are screwed so eventually as your hosting service provider if there is a way to enable it.
