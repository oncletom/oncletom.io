These days people ask me "_where_ are you at the moment?" rather than "_what_ are you up to?" and for a good reason: I have not had a home between January and April 2017.

This experience helped me tame something I have feared for a while: living without a home and without an income but a 30 litres backpack.

<!--more-->

# tl;dr

Living without a home can be a great **boost of creativity** and can **foster genuine connections** with people we have known by name on the Internets.

# A Bit of Context: Why Travelling?

[I left the BBC in December 2016](/2016/bbc/) after 4 years of employment and co-created the [_dtc innovation_ co-operative][dtc] with David and ClÃ©mentine.

It happened I have been working on a [Node.js book](/node.js/) in the open for about 3 years and I took this life change as an opportunity **to dedicate time for the writing**.

Because our [co-op business][dtc] is new and I thought the book writing as a personal experience at first, I did not want to grant myself an income and to weigh too much financially on our structure so I thought of **living on my savings** from January to July.

In addition to that, I wanted the [writing residency][residency] to be nomadic to get **to know the day to day reality of developers**, **to feel less alone** in front of my desk and **to connect and to foster a community** around the book itself.
Being nomadic also makes sense **simply because I love travelling**: it helps me think out of the box and to get fresh inspirations as I put myself out of my regular life environment.

What is the biggest monthly expense and what is useless when we are out of town? A _rent_. So on December 30<sup>th</sup> 2016, I _got my deposit back_ and moved my _belongings into a storage unit_ in London (~Â£80 per month).

# The Journey

I initially envisioned the journey to be the following:

* _2 weeks_ break to explore [Venice](/photograghy/venice/) and Israel;
* _3 weeks_ in Bordeaux to bootstrap [our co-op][dtc] and to visit my relatives;
* _6 weeks_ in 9 different cities in France to write the book.

(Now I read these lines I realise how short the writing period was and no wonder why I did not finish the bookâ€¦)

The _vacation time_ helped me to stress test the content of my backpack. I remember removing a few items I never used over the 2 weeks time. And feeling ready to tackle the next 9 weeks.

Here is what happened during the _writing_ period:

* I wrote _1<sup>1/2</sup> chapter_, blanked out _2 chapters_ and postponed _one_ through _183 commits_;
* _10 people_ contributed _30 commits_;
* I spoke at _3 meetups_ (Grenoble, Montpellier and Toulouse);
* I discovered _4 co-operative coworking venues_ ([La Myne](https://twitter.com/lamyne_) in Villeurbanne/Lyon, [la Coop](http://www.la-coop.net/) in Grenoble, [la CordÃ©e](http://www.la-cordee.net/cordee/lyon/la-cordee-liberte-guillotiere/) in Lyon, le [Yelloworking](http://yelloworking.com/) in Aix-en-Provence);
* I worked in _7 office locations_ ([beta.gouv.fr](https://beta.gouv.fr/), [Jolicode](https://jolicode.com/), [Matlo](https://www.matlo.com/), [ByteClub](http://byteclub.fr/), [Clever Cloud](https://www.clever-cloud.com/), [Alwaysdata](https://www.alwaysdata.com/), [/ut7](https://ut7.fr/));
* its costed me _309.40â‚¬ of train tickets_ between January and March to move around (slighlty less than 2 months of [London Zone 1-3 Monthly Travelcard](https://tfl.gov.uk/fares-and-payments/fares/tube-dlr-lo-fares#on-this-page-0)).

The nomadic residency was not all about work. It was also about **spending quality time with the hosts** who kindly offered me a few nights at their place, from an overnight stay to a week-end with some strolls and cooking time in common. The vast majority of my accomodations happened via _spontaneous offers_.
It was not far different from using [CouchSurfing](https://www.couchsurfing.com/) if we think about it.

I initially envisionned to settle back in London after _having finished the book in 9 weeks_ (ðŸ™„) â€” mid-March it is â€” except I had to extend the journey.
It happened [we][dtc] had to run a 3 weeks of _web development training_ in Algeria with [BBC Media Action](http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaaction/). I also needed some time to recover from the journey, to celebrate a friend's birthday and to honour a birthday outing gift as well.

It added an extra _4 weeks_ to the journey:

* _1 week_ in Paris;
* _3 days_ in Saint-Ã‰tienne (for its [Design Biennal](http://www.biennale-design.com/saint-etienne/2017/en/home/) about _work mutations_);
* _2 weeks_ in Algeria;
* _1 week_ in London, Rye and Dungeness.

Interestingly, this **extra month had no impact** on the backpack logistics: I was already used to what I was carrying and the weather was only going milder.

# Backpack Content

The bigger the bag is, the more it will contain and the more tiring it will be to carry around. _30 litres_ is a good limit as it can already be a bit heavy when filled to the max with dense items.

I used a [30 litres waterproof backpack](http://www.over-board.co.uk/pro-vis-waterproof-backpack-30-litres.html) from [Over-Board](http://www.over-board.co.uk). It has been a fellow companion for over 2 years now and I really love it because I can **max out its internal space** as well as hanging stuff outside (like the sleeping bag).

This is roughly what it contains:

* 1 light sleeping bag
* 1 pyjama (because one needs to be decent in front of other people)
* 2 merino long sleeves
* 1 merino t-shirt
* 1 coton t-shirt
* 1 coton shirt
* 2 pairs of merino socks
* 2 pairs of jean trousers
* 1 wool pullover
* 1 quart-size toiletry bag (shampoo, toothbruth, toothpaste, soap bar, microfiber towel, unscent natural deodorant stick)
* 1 laptop
* a few electronic cables and adapters
* 1 stationery purse, 20 postcards and 1 notebook
* 3 books (1 large and 2 small)
* 1 Yashika Mat 124G camera and 5 rolls of Kodak 120mm films
* 1 Instax mini camera and 2 cartridges of films
* 1 container of _rye flour_ (1Kg)
* 1 jar of sourdough starter (up to 800g)

_Merino_ is probably what makes it easier to avoid carrying stuff around. It lasts long without smelling much, it dries quickly and manages the body temperature like a charm.

I would usually have a weekly washing machine at friend's places or at the nearest laundromat.

# My Takeaways

## Connecting (with) People

The most notable fact is **communities are rather static** geographically speaking. Bouncing between cities helped both _connecting to_ their communities. I have been introduced several time to _local groups_ and I have been happily surprised how easy it is to reach the core of these communities in just a few days/local events.

Being hosted overnight by someone is like **writing a page of a story altogether**. I guess you can truly get to who are people when you zip the sleeping bag for a night on their sofa. Travelling is also just an excuse to experience this.

**French communities are great and welcoming**. Not that I doubted about it but this is now a _confirmation_.

## Sourdough Swarm

Sourdough bread baking is a matter of flour, water andâ€¦ time.

I had a few recipes with me to prepare _pizzas_ and _baguettes_. It is quite easy to do in 24 hours when working from a homely place and it adds a great vibe during dinners. Especially **when we all make and eat it together**.

It usually demonstrated it was _not that_ hard to try and it sparks quite a lot of good conversations about lifestyle, sustainability and cheese obviously ðŸ¤“

I have been very happy to give away some of my own sourdough culture to enable people to maintain their ownâ€”a _fork_ as geeks name it.

## Slow Trains Money Savers

I have been travelling by _train_ exclusively. **Trains are a great workplace** as they provide plenty of space and are rather predictable in time.

Some lines are expensive thoughâ€“mostly high speed and peak time so I cheated as I did not have a need for speed:

* use of _slow trains_;
* use of _non-refundable (and cheaper) tickets_;
* adding a _via_ station to make a detour and benefit from _slow trains_.

This way I paid 42â‚¬ to do a Nantes-Paris in 6 hours instead of 76â‚¬ (for 2 hours), and 50â‚¬ to do a Paris-Lyon in 4.5 hours instead of 97â‚¬ (and 2 hours).

## Mental Energy and Alone Time Management

Being surrounded by great people gives a boost of joy and can uplift our own morale. We get new ideas, get to share ours and we can even go back home with different perspectives on what we initially thought was not that greatâ€”it helped me a lot to figure out I was on a right track with the content of my book.

But beyond the _cool_ and _shiny diamonds_ of travelling like a nomad, there is an important concept: **resting** and **recovering**.

_Commuting_ consumes energy. So does **adapting ourselves to a new environment** (especially a city we are unfamiliar with) and **interacting with people**. Connecting with someone new for a long amount of time can cost energy for legitimate reasons: we have to think more about their boundaries, who they are, what could possibly be relevant to them.

I deliberately spent a few nights in Airbnb (Grenoble) and in hostels ([la petite auberge de St-Sernin](http://lapetiteaubergedesaintsernin.com/) in Toulouse, [Away Hostel](http://www.awayhostel.com/) in Lyon) to get away from socialisation. There is a need to be and to feel anonymous and to owe nothing to anybody to breathe a different kind of energy.

A good definition of a _home_ is a place which brings safety, comfort and rest whether it is at day or at night. I would like to add on top of this that a _home_ is a place **where we can be ourselves**: walking barefoot, working in pyjamas and brunching half of a gigantic cheese for example.

Travelling for weeks when having a partner is definitely doable and requires special attention. I always managed (although forgot once, oops ðŸ¤¥) to keep her up to date with the itinerary so as we could see each other at least every two weeks: I would halt in Paris a bit longer, she would meet me on the way.
Because it involves extra travelling cost, we would keep things simple: strolls by the ocean or in the mountain, cooking as much as possible our own meals.

# Conclusion

We are now mid-April 2017 and have I finished writing the _Node.js book_? Of courseâ€¦ _not_ ðŸ™„ (I am slightly too ambitious sometimes).
Unexpected things happened and in a good way: I reÂ·connected with my voice and tone, gained confidence about the book content, found myself productive and intuitively [practiced open documentation][nodebook-daily], a practrice that I have been missing for too long.

The _open documentation_ approach sparked business inquiries, some blog posts (both in _french_: [writing a book in 2017](https://www.quaternum.net/2017/03/07/ecrire-un-livre-en-2017/) and [a web-based publishing platform](https://www.quaternum.net/2017/03/13/une-chaine-de-publication-inspiree-du-web/)) and an insightful meeting with _arts and design students_ about their [pluridisciplinary magazine](https://fr-fr.facebook.com/Revue-Mandarine-194245834387251/).

There are certainly even cheaper ways to travel but I experienced a **good balance of expenses and quality time**, both in regard of workload and human interactions. It definitely helped me **reÂ·define my day-to-day comfort** and **to outline the minimalist needs** of what makes me happy (cf [Downscaling: Phase 3](/2015/downscaling-phase-3/)).

**Being nomadic does not have to be a permanent state of things**. We can keep our lives in _a way we feel safe about_ as well as making some space (in time) to make nomadic moves, for a week or more. I will probably spend a few weeks out of town until July to connect with other local communities as well as **spending a longer amount of time at the same place**, in a _quiet_ and _remote environment_.

Finally, I wish this write-up can feed the conversation with [Vincent](http://vinyll.github.io/) at [MiXiT](https://mixitconf.org/), in regard of his [_digital nomad_ presentation](https://mixitconf.org/en/2017/developpeur-sans-domicile-fixe).

(and hopefully the book should be ready for July ðŸ˜‹)
